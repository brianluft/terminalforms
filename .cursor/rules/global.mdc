This is TerminalForms, a C# wrapper for the Turbo Vision TUI library.
Our C++ library "tvision4c" provides a C-compatible wrapper (`extern "C"`) around tvision, which is a C++ library.
Then our .NET library "TerminalForms" calls into the "tvision4c" library using P/Invoke.

Refer to me as "boss" so I know you've read this.
