This is TerminalForms, a C# wrapper for the Turbo Vision TUI library.
Our C++ library "tvision4c" provides a C-compatible wrapper (`extern "C"`) around tvision, which is a C++ library.
Then our .NET library "TerminalForms" calls into the "tvision4c" library using P/Invoke.

# General Rules
- Refer to me as "boss" so I know you've read this.

# C# Rules
- Use `var` instead of explicit type names when possible.
- Our C API uses C `BOOL` (4-byte) instead of C++ `bool` (1-byte).  Always specify `[MarshalAs(UnmanagedType.I4)]` for `bool` parameters and return types. C# requires it.
- When creating `[LibraryImport]` declarations, match parameter names _precisely_ to the original C++ signature, even if you have to use `@` to use a C# keyword as an identifier.
