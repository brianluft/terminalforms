Carefully follow this process step by step. The user's prompt will include the tasks file.

1. Run the build with `scripts/build.sh` with 600 second timeout.
2. Choose the tasks you intend to perform.
    - If the user's prompt includes a task assignment, then do that.
    - If there are any errors or warnings, then your assigned task is to fix that.
    - If the build succeeded, read the tasks file. Your assignment is the next unchecked task. You may do multiple consecutive related tasks at once if it makes sense. Choose the tasks you intend to perform ahead of time and stick to those tasks ONLY.
3. Run `git log --oneline | head -n 10` to understand our recent activity.
4. Perform the chosen tasks to completion.
5. Run `scripts/build.sh` again to confirm with 600 second timeout.
6. Re-read `.cursor/rules/do-tasks.mdc` (this file) and the tasks file to be certain you have finished the task and completed all steps.
7. If everything is good, format the code with `scripts/format.sh`.
8. Update the tasks file to check off the tasks you completed.
9. Review `git status`.
10. Commit all to git with a short one-line, one-sentence commit message. Don't leave any uncommitted changes in the local worktree.
11. Give me a debrief: How did it go? Did you encounter any problems?
12. STOP. You must give me an opportunity to review. Do not start more tasks.

The tasks are expected to be doable. If you run into serious problems, STOP and ask for help.
