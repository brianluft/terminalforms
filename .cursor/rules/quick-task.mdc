Carefully follow this process step by step.

1. Choose the tasks you intend to perform by reading the file `project/TASKS.md`. Your assignment is the next unchecked task. You may do multiple consecutive related tasks at once if it makes sense. Choose the tasks you intend to perform ahead of time and stick to those tasks ONLY.
2. Perform the chosen tasks to completion.
3. Update `project/TASKS.md` to check off the tasks you completed. Insert a sub bullet point under the completed task, italicized and starting with ðŸ¤–, to briefly explain how you did it and any details that you can see will be necessary for future tasks in the file.
4. STOP. You must give me an opportunity to review. Do not start more tasks.

The tasks are expected to be doable. If you run into serious problems, STOP and ask for help.
