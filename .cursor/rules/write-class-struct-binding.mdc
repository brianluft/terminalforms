You will be given the name of a type to bind, below it will be `TFoo`. We will first write the C binding. Then we will use the C binding to write the C# binding. We have a strict convention to follow in order to write consistent and predictable bindings.

1. Grep for `TFoo`. Read the .h file declaring `TFoo` in `build/prefix/include/tvision/`. As you read the headers, remember that `__BORLANDC__` is _not_ defined; we are on modern platforms even though this code is set up to handle legacy platforms as well. You'll need the name of the declaring .h file later--we wll use it as part of our C# namespace. Remember it. For `TFoo` let's say it is in `bar.h`, which we will look up in the table below to find the capitalized namespace suffix `Bar`:
    app.h -> Application
    buffers.h -> Buffers
    colors.h -> Colors
    colorsel.h -> Dialogs
    config.h -> Configuration
    dialogs.h -> Dialogs
    drawbuf.h -> DrawBuffer
    editors.h -> Editors
    hardware.h -> Hardware
    help.h -> Help
    helpbase.h -> HelpBase
    menus.h -> Menus
    msgbox.h -> Dialogs
    objects.h -> Objects
    outline.h -> Outlines
    resource.h -> Resources
    scrncell.h -> ScreenCells
    stddlg.h -> Dialogs
    surface.h -> Surfaces
    system.h -> System
    textview.h -> TextView
    tkeys.h -> Keys
    tobjstrm.h -> ObjectStreams
    ttext.h -> Text
    ttypes.h -> Types
    tvobjs.h -> Objects
    util.h -> Utilities
    validate.h -> Validators
    views.h -> Views
2. Make a decision: does this type contain virtual functions or protected members, yes or no? Is it effectively static with a private constructor? This will determine which implementation pattern we follow.
3. Read the fully worked pattern provided below.
    - Base class: `src\TurboVision\NativeObject.cs` and `src\TurboVision\NativeObjectFactory.cs`
    - For types that are effectively static:
        - Skip boilerplate construction/destruction functions. Skip tv::initialize/tv::equals/std::Hash. Still create the .h file, but it will simply include common.h and tv.h with `#define Uses_TFoo`. Only write bindings for the public static functions.
        - Your input:
            - `build\prefix\include\tvision\system.h` (lines 369-387)
        - Your output:
            - `src\tvision4c\System\TClipboard.h`
            - `src\tvision4c\System\TClipboard.cpp`
            - `src\TurboVision\System\TClipboard.cs`
    - For types that DO NOT contain virtual functions or protected members:
        - You can use the underlying type as-is without subclassing it, since we wouldn't gain anything by subclassing it.
        - Your input:
            - `build\prefix\include\tvision\system.h` (lines 178-216)
        - Your output:
            - `src\tvision4c\System\MouseEventType.h`
            - `src\tvision4c\System\MouseEventType.cpp`
            - `src\TurboVision\System\MouseEventType.cs`
    - For types that DO contain virtual functions or protected members:
        - You must write a subclass `TFooImpl` (global namespace, not `tv`) to override all virtual functions and provide public access to all protected members.
        - Your input:
            - `build\prefix\include\tvision\app.h` (lines 321-342)
        - Your output:
            - `src\tvision4c\Application\TApplication.h`
            - `src\tvision4c\Application\TApplication.cpp`
            - `src\TurboVision\Application\TApplication.cs`
4. Create `src\tvision4c\Bar\TFoo.h`
5. Create `src\tvision4c\Bar\TFoo.cpp`.
6. Update `src\tvision4c\CMakeLists.txt` to add `Bar/TFoo.cpp`
7. Run `scripts/build.sh` to check for mistakes in your .h/.cpp.
8. Create `src\TurboVision\Bar\TFoo.cs` with namespace `TurboVision.Bar`.
9. Create `src\Tests\TurboVision\Bar\TFooTests.cs` with namespace `Tests.TurboVision.Bar`. At minimum, write the specific tests in the list below. Then, if you can test some getters/setters or member functions *easily* and *in isolation*, do so, but this won't always be possible for some complex classes. Test coverage is *not* a goal right now.
    - `Test_PlacementNew`
    - `Test_New`
    - `Test_Equals`
    - `Test_GetHashCode`
10. Run `scripts/build.sh` to check for mistakes in your .cs.
11. Update `doc\tvision\type_order.md` to check off `TFoo`.
