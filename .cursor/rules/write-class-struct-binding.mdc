You will be given the name of a type to bind, below it will be `Foo`. We will first write the C binding. Then we will use the C binding to write the C# binding. We have a strict convention to follow in order to write consistent and predictable bindings.

1. Grep for `Foo`. Read the .h file declaring `Foo` in `build/prefix/include/tvision/`. You'll need the name of the declaring .h file later--we wll use it as part of our C# namespace. Remember it. For `Foo` let's say it is in `bar.h`.
2. Make a decision: does this type contain virtual functions, yes or no? This will determine which implementation pattern we follow.
3. Read the fully worked pattern provided below.
    - For types that DO NOT contain virtual functions:
        - Your input:
            - `build\prefix\include\tvision\system.h` (lines 178-216)
        - Your output:
            - `src\tvision4c\KeyDownEvent.h`
            - `src\tvision4c\KeyDownEvent.cpp`
            - `src\TerminalForms\KeyDownEvent.cs`
    - For types that DO contain virtual functions: STOP and inform me. I have not yet written these instructions.
4. Create `src\tvision4c\Foo.h`
5. Create `src\tvision4c\Foo.cpp`
6. Run `scripts/build.sh` to check for mistakes in your .h/.cpp.
7. Create `src\TerminalForms\Bar\Foo.cs` with namespace `TerminalForms.Bar` -- remember that `Foo` was declared in `bar.h`. Here are the namespace suffixes for all the public tvision headers. Note that multiple .h files may be in the same C# namespace.
    app.h -> Application
    buffers.h -> Buffers
    colors.h -> Colors
    colorsel.h -> Dialogs
    config.h -> Configuration
    dialogs.h -> Dialogs
    drawbuf.h -> DrawBuffer
    editors.h -> Editors
    hardware.h -> Hardware
    help.h -> Help
    helpbase.h -> HelpBase
    menus.h -> Menus
    msgbox.h -> Dialogs
    objects.h -> Objects
    outline.h -> Outlines
    resource.h -> Resources
    scrncell.h -> ScreenCells
    stddlg.h -> Dialogs
    surface.h -> Surfaces
    system.h -> System
    textview.h -> TextView
    tkeys.h -> Keys
    tobjstrm.h -> ObjectStreams
    ttext.h -> Text
    ttypes.h -> Types
    tvobjs.h -> Objects
    util.h -> Utilities
    validate.h -> Validators
    views.h -> Views
10. Run `scripts/build.sh` to check for mistakes in your .cs.
11. Update `doc\tvision\type_order.md` to check off `Foo`.
